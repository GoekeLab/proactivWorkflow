Description:   In this workflow, we present a step-by-step analysis of promoter 
    activity from RNA-Seq data with proActiv. We begin with RNA-Seq junction files
    as input, derive promoter activity estimates, and show how to identify 
    alternative promoter usage across conditions and visualise these results. We 
    demonstrate promoter activity analysis on Kidney Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma 
    RNA-Seq data, and present novel analysis of promoter activity on single-cell 
    RNA-seq of human embryos.
